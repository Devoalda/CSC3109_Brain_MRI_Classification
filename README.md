# CSC 3109 Brain Tumor Classification

## Introduction
This project is about classifying brain tumors using machine learning.

## Folder Structure
- `data/` - Contains the dataset
- `notebooks/` - Contains the Jupyter notebooks
- `models/` - Contains the trained models

## Dataset
The dataset is not included in this repository, but its folder structure should be as follows:

- `data/`
  - `dataset_19/`
      - `glioma/`
      - `meningioma/`
      - `notumor/`
      - `pituitary/`

## Models
The trained models will be saved in the `models/` folder.

- `models/`
    - `unet_brain_mri.keras`
    - other models...

## Notebooks
The Jupyter notebooks will be saved in the `notebooks/` folder.

- `notebooks/`
    - `unet.ipynb`
    - other notebooks...
